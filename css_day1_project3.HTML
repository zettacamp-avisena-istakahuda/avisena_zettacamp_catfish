            <p>Vi is a collage student at <span class="firstSpan">UPN Veteran Yogyakarta</span>. He has some experience on ReactJS and having learned Angular a little bit. He really hopes that Angular will not be too
        different comparing to ReactJS. He really wants to get the opportunity to join in a real project with real team. Based on his perspective, learning can be done by autodidact but the best teacher is experience. Having the
        opportunity to prove his skill with the team from great company is such an experience he doesn't want to miss.
        Vi's hobby is doing <span class="secondSpan">water sports</span>.</p>

            language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a 
            markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, 
            MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
            alongside <span class="secondSpan">HTML and JavaScript</span>.</p>
