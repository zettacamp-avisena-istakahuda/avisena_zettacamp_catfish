            <p>Sarcosuchus imperator</p>
            The Sarcosuchus is a large sized, crocodyliform carnivore found in Path of 
            Titans. Sarcosuchus is a semi-aquatic creature, and takes on a more ambush 
            focused playstyle compared to other semi-aquatics in the game.
            <p>Sarcosuchus is the only crocodyliform in Path of Titans, setting it
                aside from every other creature in the game. It has a long and narrow snout full of teeth, with large
                rectangular scutes along its back. Sarcosuchus has a long, powerful tail that allows it to swim quickly
                after prey. Sarcosuchus is low to the ground and usually slower than most other creatures in Path of
                Titans, but has a surprisingly quick sprint for ambushing players.</p>
