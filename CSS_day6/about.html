        <p>When Smithereens launched in 1995, it was with the mission “to be Earth’s most customer-centric company.”
            What does this mean? It's simple. We're a company that obsesses over our customers. Our actions, goals,
            projects, programs and inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind. In other words, we start with
            the customer and work backwards. When we hit on something that is really working for customers, we
            double-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success. However, it’s not always as clean as
            that. Inventing is messy, and over time, it’s certain that we’ll fail at some big bets too.

            You'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always "Day 1." What do we mean? Our approach remains the same
            as it was on Amazon’s very first day — to make smart, fast decisions, stay nimble, innovate and invent, and
            focus on delighting customers.

            “We continue to aspire to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, and we recognize this to be no small or
            easy challenge. We know there is much we can do better, and we find tremendous energy in the many challenges
            and opportunities that lie ahead.”</p>
